Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Product update operations and details are logged and exposed, including product names, descriptions, and prices. This exposure is found in the logs on line numbers 1 and 2.
Solution: Limit the information logged during operations. Sensitive product data should not be part of standard logging. Ensure that only necessary and non-sensitive information are included in logs.

Vulnerability: CWE-532: Information Exposure Through Log Files
Issue: Log files might be accessed by unauthorized individuals leading to sensitive information exposure as captured in the logs on line numbers 1 and 2.
Solution: Implement strict access controls to protect log files from unauthorized access. Consider encrypting logs containing sensitive information.

Vulnerability: GDPR Compliance
Issue: Currently, there is no exposure of personal identifiable information (PII) and payment card information (PCI) in the logs. However, if the system starts logging such information in future, it might violate GDPR Compliance.
Solution: Explicitly program the system to exclude any PII and PCI data from logging. Regularly audit logs and data handling processes to ensure GDPR compliance.
