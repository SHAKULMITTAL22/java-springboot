================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic
Issue: The method createProduct is accepting a Product object directly from the request body. This can lead to SQL injection if the input is not properly sanitized.
Solution: Use a Data Transfer Object (DTO) to accept the data from the request and ensure all input data is properly sanitized before use.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The method createProduct does not perform any authorization checks. This could allow any authenticated user to create a product, even if they do not have the necessary permissions.
Solution: Ensure that proper authorization checks are implemented before any action is taken on the server.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: The application does not appear to have CSRF protection on its endpoints. This could allow an attacker to trick a victim into making an unwanted request to the application.
Solution: Implement CSRF protection in your application. This can be done using the built-in CSRF protection in many web frameworks, or by manually implementing a CSRF token.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to create a valid product

Details:
  TestName: testCreateValidProduct
  Description: This test is meant to check the creation of a valid product. The target scenario is when a valid product object is passed as a parameter to the createProduct method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid Product object with all necessary fields filled.
  Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the valid Product object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned Product object against the original Product object.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the returned Product object is the same as the original Product object. This confirms that the product has been successfully saved in the repository.

Scenario 2: Test to create a product with missing mandatory fields

Details:
  TestName: testCreateProductWithMissingFields
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the createProduct method when a product with missing mandatory fields is passed. The target scenario is when an invalid product object is passed as a parameter to the createProduct method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an invalid Product object with missing mandatory fields.
  Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the invalid Product object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an exception or error.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that an exception or error is thrown. This confirms that the method correctly handles invalid product objects and prevents them from being saved in the repository.

Scenario 3: Test to create a product with invalid field values

Details:
  TestName: testCreateProductWithInvalidFields
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the createProduct method when a product with invalid field values is passed. The target scenario is when a product object with invalid field values is passed as a parameter to the createProduct method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object with invalid field values.
  Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the invalid Product object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an exception or error.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that an exception or error is thrown. This confirms that the method correctly handles product objects with invalid field values and prevents them from being saved in the repository.

Scenario 4: Test to create a product when the repository is unavailable

Details:
  TestName: testCreateProductWithUnavailableRepository
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the createProduct method when the repository is unavailable. The target scenario is when the repository is down or unreachable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the repository to simulate unavailability.
  Act: Invoke the createProduct method with a valid Product object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an exception or error.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that an exception or error is thrown. This confirms that the method correctly handles scenarios when the repository is unavailable.
