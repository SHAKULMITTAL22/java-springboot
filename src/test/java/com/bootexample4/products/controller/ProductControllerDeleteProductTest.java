================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-639: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: The deleteProduct method does not verify if the user has the permission to delete the product. This can potentially allow any user to delete any product, leading to unauthorized data modification.
Solution: Implement access control checks to ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to delete the product.

Vulnerability: CWE-358: Improper Error Handling
Issue: The method does not handle exceptions, which may reveal sensitive information about the state of the application and can lead to crashes.
Solution: Wrap the method body with a try-catch block and handle exceptions properly. Don't reveal sensitive information in error messages.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: In case of an error, the response only states 'not found'. This could lead to exposure of sensitive information as it does not differentiate between a system error and an incorrect id.
Solution: Improve error handling by returning more specific error messages. However, be careful not to expose sensitive system or application information.

"""
Scenario 1: Delete Existing Product

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of deleting a product that exists in the database. It also verifies the correct response is returned after the deletion.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock product with a specific id and save it in the mock repository.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the id of the mock product.
  Assert: Verify that the productRepository's delete method is called with the mock product and the response entity status is OK.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the product is deleted correctly if it exists in the database. It also validates the expected HTTP response status (200 OK). This test is significant to ensure the application can successfully delete existing products.

Scenario 2: Delete Non-existing Product

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct.
  Description: This test checks the scenario where the application attempts to delete a product that does not exist in the database. It verifies that the correct response is returned when the product does not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure the mock repository does not contain a product with the provided id.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with an id that does not exist in the mock repository.
  Assert: Verify that the productRepository's delete method is not called and the response entity status is NOT_FOUND.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the application correctly handles attempts to delete non-existing products. It also validates the expected HTTP response status (404 NOT_FOUND). This test is significant to ensure the application can appropriately handle errors and edge cases.

Scenario 3: Delete Product with Null ID

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId.
  Description: This test checks the scenario where the application tries to delete a product with a null id. It verifies that an appropriate exception is thrown.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as the id will be null.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a null id.
  Assert: Verify that an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the application correctly handles attempts to delete a product with a null id by throwing an exception. This test is significant as it ensures the application can appropriately handle errors and edge cases.
