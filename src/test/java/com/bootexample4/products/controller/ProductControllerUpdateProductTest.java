================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: The updateProduct method does not sanitize the input received from the client. This may lead to SQL Injection if the Product object's properties are used in SQL queries without proper sanitization.
Solution: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL Injection. If you're using an ORM like Hibernate, make sure to use bind parameters in HQL queries.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The updateProduct method does not validate the input received from the client. This can lead to several vulnerabilities including XSS (Cross Site Scripting), SQL Injection etc.
Solution: Validate all inputs on server side. Use a library like Apache Commons Validator to validate inputs. Also, sanitize all inputs to avoid XSS attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-862: Missing Authorization
Issue: The updateProduct method does not check if the user is authorized to update the product. This can lead to unauthorized updates to the product by any user.
Solution: Implement an authorization check before allowing the user to update the product. This can be done using Spring Security's @PreAuthorize or @Secured annotations.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The updateProduct method assumes that the product with the given id exists. If the product does not exist, a null pointer exception will be thrown when trying to update the non-existent product.
Solution: Check if the product exists before trying to update it. If the product does not exist, return an appropriate error message.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to validate the successful update of a product

Details:
  TestName: testSuccessfulProductUpdate
  Description: This test is meant to check if the product details can be successfully updated in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an existing product for a given id and to save the updated product. Create a product object with the updated details.
  Act: Invoke the updateProduct method with the appropriate id and the product object with updated details.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity contains the updated product and the status is OK.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the product details are being updated successfully in the repository and the updated product is being returned with an OK status. This test is significant to ensure that the application can handle product updates correctly.

Scenario 2: Test to validate the response when trying to update a non-existing product

Details:
  TestName: testProductUpdateWithNonExistentId
  Description: This test is meant to check the system's response when trying to update a product that does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional for a non-existent id. Create a product object with the updated details.
  Act: Invoke the updateProduct method with a non-existent id and the product object with updated details.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity's status is NOT_FOUND.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the system responds with a NOT_FOUND status when trying to update a product that does not exist. This test is important to ensure that the system can handle attempts to update non-existing products gracefully.

Scenario 3: Test to validate the response when trying to update a product with invalid details

Details:
  TestName: testProductUpdateWithInvalidDetails
  Description: This test is meant to check the system's response when trying to update a product with invalid details such as a negative price.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an existing product for a given id. Create a product object with invalid details like a negative price.
  Act: Invoke the updateProduct method with the appropriate id and the product object with invalid details.
  Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the system throws an exception when trying to update a product with invalid details. This test is crucial to ensure that the system can prevent the update of products with invalid details.
