Scenario 1: Setting a valid positive price
Details:
  TestName: setValidPositivePrice
  Description: This test checks if the setPrice method correctly updates the price when a valid positive double is passed. It validates that the method handles standard positive values correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class containing the setPrice method.
  Act: Call the setPrice method with a positive double value.
  Assert: Check if the price field of the object is updated to the expected positive value.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the price field is equal to the positive value passed to setPrice. This confirms that the method accurately updates the price with normal expected values. It is significant as it ensures the method behaves correctly under typical usage conditions.
Scenario 2: Setting a price of zero
Details:
  TestName: setPriceToZero
  Description: This test verifies whether the setPrice method can handle and correctly set the price to zero, which might represent free or no-cost items.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class.
  Act: Call the setPrice method with a value of 0.0.
  Assert: Check that the price field is updated to 0.0.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the price field equals 0.0 after the method call. This is important to confirm that the method can handle edge cases like zero pricing, which could be used for promotions or specific business cases.
Scenario 3: Setting a negative price
Details:
  TestName: setNegativePrice
  Description: This test evaluates how the setPrice method deals with negative values. This is crucial for ensuring that the method does not accept values that could represent an invalid state in the business logic (e.g., negative pricing).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a negative value, e.g., -10.0.
  Assert: Check that the price field reflects the negative value.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the price field equals the negative value provided. This test is significant as it checks the method's behavior with inputs that should typically be handled as errors or validations within the method or at higher levels of the application to prevent business logic flaws.
Scenario 4: Setting a very large positive price
Details:
  TestName: setExtremelyHighPrice
  Description: Tests the setPrice method's ability to handle extremely large values, which might be outside typical operational ranges but still valid double values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the class instance.
  Act: Call setPrice with a very high double value, such as Double.MAX_VALUE.
  Assert: Confirm that the price field is set to Double.MAX_VALUE.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the field is updated to Double.MAX_VALUE, testing the method's capacity to handle large numbers without error. This is crucial for applications that might deal with high-value transactions or calculations.
These scenarios collectively help ensure that the setPrice method is robust, handles a variety of inputs appropriately, and meets the business requirements and constraints of the application.
