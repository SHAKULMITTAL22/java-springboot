================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The setId method is public and allows for setting the ID of an entity from outside the class. This could potentially allow for an ID to be changed or manipulated, leading to unauthorized access or information exposure.
Solution: Reduce the visibility of the setId method or add additional checks to validate the ID before setting it. Consider using a constructor to set the ID when creating an object, rather than allowing it to be changed later.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: If the ID is sensitive information, such as a user ID or personal identifier, exposing the setId method publicly could lead to privacy violations. An attacker could potentially change the ID to gain access to information they should not have access to.
Solution: Consider whether the ID needs to be changed after an object is created. If not, remove the setId method. If it does need to be changed, add additional checks to validate the new ID before setting it, and consider using a more secure method of changing the ID, such as a method that requires authentication.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Test to validate the successful setting of ID

Details:
  TestName: setIdSuccessfully
  Description: This test is meant to check if the 'setId' method successfully sets the given ID to the corresponding object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock object and a valid ID.
  Act: Invoke the 'setId' method with the valid ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual ID of the object against the expected ID.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the ID of the object is set correctly. The expected result is that the actual ID and the expected ID should match. This test is significant to ensure that the 'setId' method works as expected.

Scenario 2: Test to validate the behavior when null ID is set

Details:
  TestName: setNullId
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the 'setId' method when a null ID is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock object.
  Act: Invoke the 'setId' method with a null ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the ID of the object is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the ID of the object is null when a null ID is set. The expected result is that the actual ID should be null. This test is significant to ensure that the 'setId' method can handle null inputs.

Scenario 3: Test to validate the behavior when ID is set to zero

Details:
  TestName: setZeroId
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the 'setId' method when the ID is set to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock object.
  Act: Invoke the 'setId' method with an ID of zero.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the ID of the object is zero.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the ID of the object is zero when an ID of zero is set. The expected result is that the actual ID should be zero. This test is significant to ensure that the 'setId' method can handle zero inputs.

Scenario 4: Test to validate the behavior when ID is set to a negative number

Details:
  TestName: setNegativeId
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the 'setId' method when the ID is set to a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock object.
  Act: Invoke the 'setId' method with a negative ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the ID of the object is the negative number.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the ID of the object is the negative number when a negative ID is set. The expected result is that the actual ID should be the negative number. This test is significant to ensure that the 'setId' method can handle negative inputs.
