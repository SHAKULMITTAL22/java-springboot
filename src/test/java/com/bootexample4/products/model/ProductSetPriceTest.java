================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: The 'setPrice' method does not perform any validation on the 'price' parameter. This could lead to potential security risks such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), or Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the input is used in a security-sensitive context.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that the 'price' parameter meets the expected format and range. Use a safe API that avoids the use of the interpreter entirely or provides a parameterized interface.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: If the 'setPrice' method is used in a GET request, the price could be exposed in the URL. This could lead to potential security risks as URLs are logged in various locations such as browser history, network logs, etc.
Solution: Avoid using sensitive data in GET request query strings. Instead, use POST requests or other methods where the data is included in the body of the request, not in the URL.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test for Positive Price Value

  Details:
    TestName: testPriceWithPositiveValue
    Description: This test aims to check if the method correctly sets the price when a positive value is given as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a price value with a positive double.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the positive price value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the price has been set correctly.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the setPrice method correctly sets the price when a positive value is provided. This is important to ensure that the method behaves as expected in normal use cases.

  Scenario 2: Test for Zero Price Value

  Details:
    TestName: testPriceWithZeroValue
    Description: This test aims to check if the method correctly sets the price when the value is zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a price value with zero.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the zero price value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the price has been set to zero.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the setPrice method correctly sets the price when the value is zero. This is important to ensure that the method behaves as expected in edge cases.

  Scenario 3: Test for Negative Price Value

  Details:
    TestName: testPriceWithNegativeValue
    Description: This test aims to check if the method behaves correctly when a negative value is given as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a price value with a negative double.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the negative price value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the price has been set to the negative value.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the setPrice method correctly sets the price even when a negative value is provided. This is important to ensure that the method behaves as expected in edge cases.

  Scenario 4: Test for Large Price Value

  Details:
    TestName: testPriceWithLargeValue
    Description: This test aims to check if the method behaves correctly when a large value is given as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a price value with a large double.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the large price value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the price has been set to the large value.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the setPrice method correctly sets the price even when a large value is provided. This is important to ensure that the method behaves as expected in edge cases.
