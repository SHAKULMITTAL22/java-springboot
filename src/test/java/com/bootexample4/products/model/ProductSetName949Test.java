================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: If 'name' is output in responses without proper escaping, it could lead to XSS attacks where malicious scripts are executed in the browser of users visiting the web page.
Solution: Ensure that any user input is escaped appropriately before being rendered on web pages, or use frameworks that automatically handle escaping.
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: Without proper validation, setting 'name' directly from user input can lead to various issues including security vulnerabilities, such as SQL Injection if used in SQL queries, or logic errors in application.
Solution: Implement robust validation and sanitization of inputs before using them in the application. Use prepared statements or ORM methods for database access.
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Exposing sensitive information through error messages or logging that includes values such as 'name' can lead to information leakage.
Solution: Use generic error messages for users and ensure detailed logs are only accessible to authorized personnel. Avoid logging sensitive information.
================================================================================

Scenario 1: Set Name with Leading and Trailing Spaces
Details:
  TestName: setNameWithLeadingAndTrailingSpaces
  Description: Test to verify if the setName method trims leading and trailing spaces from the input string before setting the name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Product.
  Act: Call setName with a name string that includes leading and trailing spaces.
  Assert: Assert that the name is stored without these spaces.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the name is stored correctly formatted without unnecessary spaces, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and consistency in user inputs.
Scenario 2: Set Name with Special Characters
Details:
  TestName: setNameWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: Ensure that the setName method can handle names containing special characters without throwing any errors or altering the input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Product.
  Act: Call setName with a string containing special characters (e.g., "@#$%^&*()").
  Assert: Assert that the name is exactly as set, including the special characters.
Validation:
  Validates that the system can handle names with non-alphanumeric characters, reflecting the flexibility required in a diverse product catalog.
Scenario 3: Set Name with Unicode Characters
Details:
  TestName: setNameWithUnicodeCharacters
  Description: Test to confirm that the setName method correctly handles names containing Unicode characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Product.
  Act: Call setName with a string containing Unicode characters (e.g., "测试产品").
  Assert: Assert that the name includes the Unicode characters.
Validation:
  This ensures that the application supports internationalization by correctly handling Unicode inputs, which is essential for global market compatibility.
Scenario 4: Set Name to a Previous Value
Details:
  TestName: setNameToPreviousValue
  Description: Verify if setting the name to a previously set value is handled correctly without any errors or data corruption.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Product and set a name.
  Act: Reset the name to the same value.
  Assert: Assert that the name remains unchanged and correctly set.
Validation:
  Checks the idempotence of the setName method, ensuring that setting the same value multiple times does not lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
Scenario 5: Set Name with SQL Injection Characters
Details:
  TestName: setNameWithSqlInjectionCharacters
  Description: Ensure that the setName method can handle input strings that might be used for SQL injection attacks without compromising the system.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Product.
  Act: Call setName with a string that includes SQL injection patterns (e.g., "1; DROP TABLE users").
  Assert: Assert that the name is set as provided.
Validation:
  Validates the robustness of the input handling in the setName method, crucial for preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities when names are used in database queries.
Scenario 6: Set Name when Product is Persisted
Details:
  TestName: setNameWhenProductIsPersisted
  Description: Test to ensure that setName correctly updates the name in the database for a persisted product entity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Retrieve a persisted Product entity from the database.
  Act: Update the name using setName and persist the changes.
  Assert: Fetch the product again and verify the updated name.
Validation:
  Checks the effective integration of setName with the persistence layer, ensuring that changes are correctly stored in the database, which is vital for data integrity and consistency.
