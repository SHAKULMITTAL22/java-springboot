================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getId() method might be used in HTTP GET requests, exposing potentially sensitive information in URLs.
Solution: Avoid using sensitive data in GET requests. Use HTTP POST requests instead.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: Exposing the internal id of a database record can potentially leak sensitive information about the underlying system, or be used in further attacks.
Solution: Consider using UUIDs or other non-sequential identifiers for exposed data.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Without any validation or access control, the getId() method can potentially expose sensitive information to unauthorized users.
Solution: Implement appropriate access controls and validate inputs to ensure that only authorized users can access data.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the getId method returns the correct Id

Details:
  TestName: testGetIdReturnsCorrectId
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getId method is returning the correct Id value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock entity with a known Id.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the mock entity.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected Id.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getId method is correctly returning the Id of the entity. The expected result is the known Id of the mock entity. This is significant as it ensures the getId method is functioning as expected, which is critical for retrieving the correct Id of an entity in the application.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the getId method returns null when the Id is not set

Details:
  TestName: testGetIdReturnsNullWhenIdNotSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getId method returns null when the Id of the entity is not set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock entity without setting an Id.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the mock entity.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned Id is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getId method correctly handles the case when the Id is not set and returns null. This is significant as it confirms the getId method's behavior in situations where the Id of an entity has not been set.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the getId method returns the correct Id after the Id has been changed

Details:
  TestName: testGetIdReturnsUpdatedIdAfterChange
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getId method returns the updated Id after the Id of the entity has been changed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock entity with a known Id, then change the Id to a new value.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the mock entity.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the new Id.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getId method is returning the new Id after it has been changed. The expected result is the new Id. This test is significant as it ensures that the getId method correctly reflects changes to the Id of an entity in the application.
