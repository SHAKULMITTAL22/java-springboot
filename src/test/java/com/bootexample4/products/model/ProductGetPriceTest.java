================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getPrice() method might be used in HTTP GET requests, exposing sensitive information through URLs. This information can be logged in various places like browser history, server logs, or proxy servers.
Solution: Avoid using sensitive information in HTTP GET requests. Use HTTP POST requests instead or encrypt the data before sending.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The getPrice() method might be used for debugging purposes and forgotten to be removed, which can expose sensitive information to an attacker.
Solution: Always remove debug code or information outputs in production. Use logging that can be enabled or disabled based on the environment.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The getPrice() method might be exposing sensitive private information which could be used by an attacker for malicious purposes.
Solution: Implement access controls and ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive information. Use encryption where necessary.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if getPrice method returns the correct price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsCorrectPrice
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns the correct price of the product.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the price of the product.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned price is correct.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the getPrice method is functioning correctly. The expected result is the price that was set for the product. This test is significant as it ensures the correct price of the product is returned, which is critical for the business logic of pricing in the application.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getPrice method returns zero when no price is set

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsZeroWhenNoPriceIsSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns zero when no price is set for the product.
Execution:
  Arrange: Don't set any price for the product.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned price is zero.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the getPrice method returns zero when no price is set. The expected result is zero. This test is significant as it checks the default behavior of the getPrice method, which is important for handling products without a set price in the application.

Scenario 3: Test to check if getPrice method returns negative price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsNegativePrice
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a negative price when a product's price is set to a negative value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a negative price for the product.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned price is negative.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the getPrice method can return a negative price. The expected result is the negative price that was set. This test is significant as it checks the behavior of the getPrice method when dealing with negative prices, which could occur due to bugs or errors in the application.
